1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
`.map` creates a brand new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is a property of an object, but is fundamentally still a function.

3. What is closure?
Allows for nested function to still use parameters and variables inside the parent function.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

1. Window Binding - When you call a function if none of the rules apply the 'this' keyword defaults to the window object.

2. Implicit Binding - When you call a function or when it is invoked, to the left of the dot is what what 'this' is referencing.

3. New Binding - When function is invoked with new keyword the 'this' keyword inside function is bound to constructed item.

4. Explicit Binding - When you call a function you explicitly state what the 'this' keyword is going to reference.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

Super() is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
